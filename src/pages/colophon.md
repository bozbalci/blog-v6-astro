This site uses three fonts:

1. Headings, captions, and various UI elements are set in [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/).
2. Body text is set in [Charter](https://practicaltypography.com/charter.html).
3. Monospace font (code blocks, metadata, etc.) is set in [MonoLisa](https://www.monolisa.dev/).

### Fluid type scale

This site was designed using a [fluid type scale](https://utopia.fyi/blog/designing-with-fluid-type-scales/) by [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/). Font sizes are calculated in CSS, interpolating between mobile and desktop sizes depending on the current browser width.

## Accessibility

This site aims to conform to the Level AA accessibility standards outlined in the [WCAG 2.2 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/). _Aims_ is the key word here, Iâ€™m still reading through the specs and making small tweaks every day.
