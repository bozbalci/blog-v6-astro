My name is Berk Özbalcı (pronunciation[^1]) and I’m a software engineer based in London, currently working for Apple.

I have over six years of professional experience in the payments industry. My current work is on Apple Pay, where I help build backend services that serve billions of customers worldwide.

Outside work, I:

- shoot photos with my Fujifilm X-T5, where the best ones are uploaded into the [gallery](/gallery).
- collect and listen to vinyl records. You can [view my collection](/music-collection) on this site.
- brew coffee and make lattes. If it looks like *anything at all,* I post it to my [latte art album](/gallery/album/latte-art) too!

## About this site

I designed and built this website to have an online presence outside social media.

In my opinion, online avenues for proper self-expression is shrinking every day as traffic gets consolidated into a handful of massive sites, or as [Tom Eastman](https://twitter.com/tveastman/) once succinctly put it, “five giant websites, each filled with screenshots of the other four.” Not this site. This is my own.

You can find notes on how the site was made in the [Colophon](/colophon).
