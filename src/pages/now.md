## Photography

I’ve recently got myself a Fujifilm X-T5 and I’ve been taking it with me almost every day I go outside. On the 20th of July, I will be at [The Royal International Air Tattoo](https://www.airtattoo.com), which is exciting because it will be the first time I’m attending an airshow! I rented the Fujifilm [XF150-600mmF5.6-8 R LM OIS WR](https://fujifilm-x.com/en-gb/products/lenses/xf150-600mmf56-8-r-lm-ois-wr/) for the occasion.

My everyday carry lens is a Fujifilm [XF16-55mmF2.8 R LM WR](https://fujifilm-x.com/en-gb/products/lenses/xf16-55mmf28-r-lm-wr/).

I will be uploading the pictures here, stay tuned!

## Coding

These days my main coding project is this website. I’m coding a custom, classic WordPress theme, but I plan to switch to a full-site editing block theme in the future. My current focus is improving the site’s design, mainly typography. Next up will be more IndieWeb features and refining accessibility.

I’m currently reading [Haskell Programming from First Principles](https://haskellbook.com) by Christopher Allen and Julie Moronuki, mostly for the enjoyment I get from functional programming.

## Music

You can visit my [Last.fm profile](https://www.last.fm/user/theconjuring666) to see my latest scrobbles[^1]. Recently I’ve been listening to a lot of Charli XCX, especially her latest album _brat_. Usually I discover new music through friends’ recommendations or [RateYourMusic](https://rateyourmusic.com), but for the past few weeks I’ve been going through Paste Magazine’s [The 300 Greatest Albums of All Time](https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/greatest-albums/the-300-greatest-albums-of-all-time-2) list, listening to records I haven’t heard before.

I’m generally not interested in such lists, but this one in particular seemed to have interesting and varied picks, especially compared to [Apple Music’s picks](https://100best.music.apple.com/) released around the same time, which was, let’s say, questionable.

## Work

I’m currently working on top-secret projects in the Apple Pay backend, which I cannot talk about in this blog!

[^1]: A “scrobble” is a digital record of a song that you have listened to. The most popular platform for scrobbling is [Last.fm](https://last.fm). The [IndieWeb wiki](https://indieweb.org/scrobble) article on scrobbling is a good read. In the future, I plan to publish my scrobbles directly to this website using WordPress plugins.
